# TomÃ¡s Hogan & Oisin Martyn web submission 2025
A prototype of the index page can be located in Prototypes->index.pdf, however this was largely refactored
## Test cases
Testing methodology included the following
- Reusing components throughout the project that have been previously tested and shown to not cause visual bugs (such as images clipping outside of their containers)
- Manually testing the Navigation bar links prior to each git commit, ensuring that the main branch remained error free
## 3rd party libraries and acknowledgements
- getbootstrap.com was used as a css framework
- checkout page largely influenced by [bootstrap examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/)
